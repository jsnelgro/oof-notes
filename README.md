# Oof Notes

"Oof" because I've wasted so much time in my life tinkering with frontend frameworks and haven't gotten anywhere with
them.

I like Valtio. It feels like how state management should be. Just an object that you can mess with. And your UI just
reacts to the changes. Easy.

I don't like React so much... it's so bloated and slow and doing things like conditionals is ugly. But it's hard to
escape React. SolidJS looks cool, but it has
its own reactivity system built in and I didn't like it as much as Valtio. Also I like having state management seperate.
I can hack on the logic without worrying
about the UI too much.

# Running Locally

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

# TODO

- [] choose a UI library. Thinking either [mantine](https://mantine.dev/pages/getting-started/)
  or [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
    - mantine is wayyy more full-featured. It's just weird that I haven't really heard anything about it... seems fishy.
      Like, maybe it has a weird license or something?
